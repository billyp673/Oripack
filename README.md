The Official Oripack modpack for Minecraft, made by billyp673<br />
Have you ever looked at a Modpack and thought, "I'd love to play this with my friends, but they don't know how to computer"?<br />
Perhaps you are that friend, and that's OK! Because I've made a modpack with a handy-dandy installer for you!<br />
Here's an Origins modpack with 40 Origins, 13 Classes, better biomes, structures and bosses!
<br />
  <h1>Releases</h1>
You can find the release version at:
https://github.com/billyp673/Oripack/releases
  <h1>Credits and Sources for Skeptics</h1>
If you don't trust a random stranger on the internet giving you executables (especially since python can cause anti-virus false positives), here's the link to the mods, configs and datapack.<br />
Keep in mind however that you can literally look at the source code here, so installing this modpack manually is just making things more difficult for no reason.
